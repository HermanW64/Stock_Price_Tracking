# Project description
It helps you to track and visualize the performance of your favourite stocks, so that you can make informed decisions about your stock investment. The purpose is NOT to help you make money or tell you when to buy or sell a stock. The reason is that the stock market is generally highly unpredictable and complicated. 

Anyway, it is a beginner-friendly project, no matter you are a Python beginner or a finance beginner, you can gain valuable insights and skills from this project. The project is still in progress.

# Project highlights


# Key financial terms
## Stock symbol (ticker)
A unique series of letter assigned to a stock or a security for trading purposes. It serves as identifier for each stock or security in the market.

## Dividend
The part of a company's earnings that will be paid to its shareholders. It comes to shareholders instead of the company's business.

## Split
The company divides its existing shares into a new number of shares, usually to increase the number of shares while decreasing the value of each share.

## Dataset fields (column names)
### Open
Stock price at the beginning of the trading day.

### High
The highest stock price achieved during the trading day.

### Low
The lowest stock price achieved during the trading day.

### Close
Stock price at the end of the trading day, usually considered as the most important price of the day.

### Adjusted Close
Adjusted for dividends and splits, it provides a more accurate representation of the stock price. For example, adjusted close price can be calculated by removing dividends from the close price.

If the company offers more stock shares, the adjusted close price might be lower. It also happens when the company splits its stock shares.

### Volume:
The total number of shares traded during the day. Higher volumes suggest greater interest in the stock.

## Today's close and next trading day's open
The stock prices can still fluctuate during the period, influenced by:
- Positive or negative news/sentiment about the company, industry, or the any related topics
- After-hours trading and pre-market trading. 

So never expect the next day's open to be the same as today's close.
